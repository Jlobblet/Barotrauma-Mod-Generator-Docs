Features
---------

- Simple syntax: use XML like you already know to create mods.
- Flexible file format: the Mod Generator copies the file structure you
  create, meaning there are never any issues with overwritten files.
- Easy to keep track of changes: only tweak the values you want to, making
  updating your mod to future versions of Barotrauma easy, and making source
  control truly viable.
